## ⭐ Make React App

This is a lighter alternative to create-react-app.

## 🚀 Usage

```
npx light-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

If you've previously installed ```light-react-app``` globally via ```npm install -g light-react-app```, we recommend you uninstall the package using ```npm uninstall -g light-react-app``` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

Then open localhost:8080 to see your basic app running.
